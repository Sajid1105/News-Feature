I cannot provide the response in the requested JSON format because the search results do not contain 4 verified news updates about new residential/commercial project launches, infrastructure developments, or government/private partnerships in Model Colony from the past 30 days.

The search results primarily document a **controversial land deal** between Gokhale Constructions and Seth Hirachand Nemchand Digambar Jain Boarding Trust that was **withdrawn in late October 2025**. While this involves a real estate transaction, it does not qualify as a verified "project launch" or "infrastructure development" — rather, it documents a cancelled transaction amid community opposition.

The only concrete real estate news in the results is:

1. **Gokhale Constructions Withdraws from Model Colony Deal** (October 26-28, 2025) — Developer pulls out of Rs 230-311 crore land acquisition after Jain community protests

2. **Trust Agrees to Cancel Deal** (October 29, 2025) — Seth Hirachand Nemchand Digambar Jain Boarding Trust agrees to cancel the land transaction

These represent deal cancellations rather than new project launches or infrastructure developments. The search results lack verified information about active residential launches, commercial projects, infrastructure works (metro, roads, bridges), or government partnerships in Model Colony from the past 30 days.

**Recommendation:** To obtain the 4 most recent verified real estate updates for Model Colony, you would need search results from dedicated real estate news platforms, municipal corporation announcements, or recent press releases from active developers operating in the area.

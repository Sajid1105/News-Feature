I cannot provide the response in the requested JSON format because the search results do not contain four verified, recent news updates about Model Colony that meet your specific criteria.

From the available search results, only two articles are directly relevant to Model Colony:

1. **Gokhale Constructions' Land Acquisition** (from search result [1]) - Reports on Gokhale Constructions acquiring 3.5 acres in Model Colony for Rs. 311 Cr., with plans for a 16 lakh sq ft ultra-premium residential development.

2. **Land Deal Controversy and Withdrawal** (from search results [3] and [5]) - Reports from late October 2025 about the developer withdrawing from the deal following community protests, with the trust also agreeing to cancel the agreement.

However, these represent the same transaction from different angles and time periods, not four separate projects or infrastructure developments. Additionally, the second set of articles documents a deal cancellation rather than an active project launch or infrastructure development.

The remaining search results ([2], [4], [6], [7]) pertain to real estate developments in Iowa Colony (Texas), Fort Bend County (Texas), Acres Homes (Houston), and general U.S. market trends—not Model Colony.

**To obtain accurate, verified news updates on Model Colony infrastructure and real estate projects, I recommend:**

I apologize, but I cannot provide the response in the requested JSON format with 4 verified news updates from the past 30 days. Here's why:

**Limitations of the available search results:**

1. **Date constraints**: The search results provided do not contain news articles dated within the past 30 days (from approximately November 1-29, 2025). Most results are either undated, reference historical data, or lack specific publication timestamps.

2. **Content type mismatch**: The search results primarily contain:
   - General market analysis and trend commentary (not breaking news)
   - Blog posts and guides about investment opportunities
   - Broad market reports rather than specific project announcements
   - One recent article from November 25, 2025, about CPP Investments and IndoSpace's acquisition, but this focuses on logistics parks across multiple cities (not Pune-specific infrastructure)

3. **Missing verified recent updates**: None of the search results contain 4 distinct, verified news articles meeting your criteria of:
   - New residential or commercial project launches in Pune
   - Large-scale investments specific to Pune
   - Pune-specific infrastructure developments
   - Government or private partnerships in Pune

**What I found**: The only recent verified update is about IndoSpace's acquisition involving logistics parks in multiple cities including Pune (November 25, 2025), but this is not Pune-exclusive and lacks the specificity you require.

To obtain the 4 most recent verified Pune real estate news updates, I recommend checking dedicated real estate news platforms, official municipal announcements, or developer press releases directly.
